# Blink: Running Your First App

This guide will help you get the `blink` app running on top of Tock kernel.

## Instructions

1.  **Erase any existing applications**. First, we need to remove any
    applications already on the board. Note that Tockloader by default will
    install any application in addition to whatever is already installed on the
    board.

    ```bash
    $ tockloader erase-apps
    ```

2.  **Install Blink**. Tock supports an "app store" of sorts. That is,
    tockloader can install apps from a remote repository, including Blink. To do
    this:

    ```bash
    $ tockloader install blink
    ```

    You will have to tell Tockloader that you are OK with fetching the app from
    the Internet.

    Your specific board may require additional arguments, please see the readme
    in the `boards/` folder for more details.

3.  **Compile and Install Blink**. We can also compile the blink app and load
    our compiled version. The basic C version of blink is located in the
    [libtock-c](https://github.com/tock/libtock-c) repository.

    1. Clone that repository:

       ```bash
       $ cd tock-book
       $ git clone https://github.com/tock/libtock-c
       ```

    2. Then navigate to `examples/blink`:

       ```bash
       $ cd libtock-c/examples/blink
       ```

    3. From there, you should be able to compile it and install it by:

       ```bash
       $ make
       $ tockloader install
       ```

    When the blink app is installed you should see the LEDs on the board
    blinking. Congratulations! You have just programmed your first Tock
    application.
