# Implementing an in-kernel Virtualization Layer

This guide provides an overview and walkthrough on how to add an in-kernel
virtualization layer, such that a given hardware interface can be used
simultaneously by multiple kernel capsules, or used simultaneously by a single
kernel capsule and userspace. Ideally, virtual interfaces will be available for
all hardware interfaces in Tock. Some example interfaces which have already been
virtualized include Alarm, SPI, Flash, UART, I2C, ADC, and others.

In this guide we will use a running example of virtualizing a single hardware
SPI peripheral and bus for use as a SPI Master.

## Setup

This guide assumes you already have existing kernel code that needs to be
virtualized. There should be an existing HIL for the resource you are
virtualizing.

We will assume there is a `trait SpiMaster {...}` already defined and
implemented that includes all of the logic needed to interface with the
underlying SPI. We also assume there is a `trait SpiMasterClient` that
determines the interface a client of the SPI exposes to the underlying resource.
In most cases, equivalent traits will represent a necessary precursor to
virtualization.

## Overview

The high-level steps required are:

1. Create a capsule file for your virtualizer
2. Determine what portions of this interface should be virtualized.
3. Create a `MuxXXX` struct, which will serve as the lone client of the
   underlying resource.
4. Create a `VirtualXXXDevice` which will implement the underlying HIL trait,
   allowing for the appearance of multiple of the lone resource.
5. Implement the logic for queuing requests from capsules.
6. Implement the logic for dispatching callbacks from the underlying resource to
   the appropriate client.
7. Document the interface.
8. (Optional) Write tests for the virtualization logic.

## Step-by-Step Guide

The steps from the overview are elaborated on here.

1. **Create a capsule file for your virtualizer**

   This step is easy. Navigate to the `capsules/src/` directory and create a new
   file named `virtual_xxx`, where `xxx` is the name of the underlying resource
   being virtualized. All of the code you will write while following this guide
   belongs in that file. Additionally, open `capsules/src/lib.rs` and add
   `pub mod virtual_xxx;` to the list of modules.

2. **Determine what portions of this interface should be virtualized**

   Generally, this step requires looking at the HIL being virtualized, and
   determining what portions of the HIL require additional logic to handle
   multiple concurrent clients. Lets take a look at the SPIMaster HIL:

   ```rust
   pub trait SpiMaster {
       fn set_client(&self, client: &'static dyn SpiMasterClient);

       fn init(&self);
       fn is_busy(&self) -> bool;

       /// Perform an asynchronous read/write operation, whose
       /// completion is signaled by invoking SpiMasterClient on
       /// the initialized client.
       fn read_write_bytes(
           &self,
           write_buffer: &'static mut [u8],
           read_buffer: Option<&'static mut [u8]>,
           len: usize,
       ) -> ReturnCode;
       fn write_byte(&self, val: u8);
       fn read_byte(&self) -> u8;
       fn read_write_byte(&self, val: u8) -> u8;

       /// Tell the SPI peripheral what to use as a chip select pin.
       fn specify_chip_select(&self, cs: Self::ChipSelect);

       /// Returns the actual rate set
       fn set_rate(&self, rate: u32) -> u32;
       fn get_rate(&self) -> u32;
       fn set_clock(&self, polarity: ClockPolarity);
       fn get_clock(&self) -> ClockPolarity;
       fn set_phase(&self, phase: ClockPhase);
       fn get_phase(&self) -> ClockPhase;

       // These two functions determine what happens to the chip
       // select line between transfers. If hold_low() is called,
       // then the chip select line is held low after transfers
       // complete. If release_low() is called, then the chip select
       // line is brought high after a transfer completes. A "transfer"
       // is any of the read/read_write calls. These functions
       // allow an application to manually control when the
       // CS line is high or low, such that it can issue multi-byte
       // requests with single byte operations.
       fn hold_low(&self);
       fn release_low(&self);
   }
   ```

   For some of these functions, it is clear that no virtualization is required.
   For example, `get_rate()`, `get_phase()` and `get_polarity()` simply request
   information on the current configuration of the underlying hardware.
   Implementations of these can simply pass the call straight through the mux.

   Some other functions are not appropriate to expose to virtual clients at all.
   For example, `hold_low()`, `release_low()`, and `specify_chip_select()` are
   not suitable for use when the underlying bus is shared. `init()` does not
   make sense when it is unclear which client should call it. The mux should
   queue operations, so clients should not need access to `is_busy()`.

   For other functions, it is clear that virtualization _is_ necessary. For
   example, it is clear that if multiple clients are using the Mux, they cannot
   all be allowed set the rate of the underlying hardware at arbitrary times, as
   doing so could break an ongoing operation initiated by an underlying client.
   However, it is important to expose this functionality to clients. Thus
   `set_rate()`, `set_clock()` and `set_phase()` need to be virtualized, and
   provided to virtual clients. `set_client()` needs to be adapted to support
   multiple simultaneous clients.

   Finally, virtual clients need a way to send and receive on the bus. Single
   byte writes and reads are typically only used under the assumption that a
   single client is going to make multiple single byte reads/writes
   consecutively, and thus are inappropriate to virtualize. Instead, the virtual
   interface should only include `read_write_bytes()`, as that encapsulates the
   entire transaction that would be desired by a virtual client.

   Given that not all parts of the original HIL trait (`SpiMaster`) are
   appropriate for virtualization, we should create a new trait in the SPI HIL
   that will represent the interface provided to clients of the Virtual SPI:

   ```rust
   //! kernel/src/hil/spi.rs
   ...
   /// SPIMasterDevice provides a chip-specific interface to the SPI Master
   /// hardware. The interface wraps the chip select line so that chip drivers
   /// cannot communicate with different SPI devices.
   pub trait SpiMasterDevice {
       /// Perform an asynchronous read/write operation, whose
       /// completion is signaled by invoking SpiMasterClient.read_write_done on
       /// the provided client.
       fn read_write_bytes(
           &self,
           write_buffer: &'static mut [u8],
           read_buffer: Option<&'static mut [u8]>,
           len: usize,
       ) -> ReturnCode;

       /// Helper function to set polarity, clock phase, and rate all at once.
       fn configure(&self, cpol: ClockPolarity, cpal: ClockPhase, rate: u32);
       fn set_polarity(&self, cpol: ClockPolarity);
       fn set_phase(&self, cpal: ClockPhase);
       fn set_rate(&self, rate: u32);

       fn get_polarity(&self) -> ClockPolarity;
       fn get_phase(&self) -> ClockPhase;
       fn get_rate(&self) -> u32;
   }
   ```

   Not all virtualizers will require a new trait to provide virtualization! For
   example, `VirtualMuxDigest` exposes the same `Digest` HIL as the underlying
   hardware. Same for `VirtualAlarm`, `VirtualUart`, and `MuxFlash`.
   `VirtualI2C` does use a different trait, similarly to SPI, and `VirtualADC`
   introduces an `AdcChannel` trait to enable virtualization that is not
   possible with the ADC interface implemented by hardware.

   There is no fixed algorithm for deciding exactly how to virtualize a given
   interface, and doing so will require thinking carefully about the
   requirements of the clients and nature of the underlying resource. Tock's
   [threat model](https://github.com/tock/tock/tree/master/doc/threat_model)
   describes several requirements for virtualizers in its
   [virtualization section](https://github.com/tock/tock/blob/master/doc/threat_model/Virtualization.md).

   > Note: You should read these requirements!! They discuss things like the
   > confidentiality and fairness requirements for virtualizers.

   Beyond the threat model, you should think carefully about how virtual clients
   will use the interface, the overhead (in cycles / code size / RAM use) of
   different approaches, and how the interface will work in the face of multiple
   concurrent requests. It is also important to consider the potential for two
   layers of virtualization, when one of the clients of the virtualization
   capsule is a userspace driver that will also be virtualizing that same
   resource. In some cases (see: UDP port reservations) special casing the
   userspace driver may be valuable.

   Frequently the best approach will involve looking for an already virtualized
   resource that is qualitatively similar to the resource you are working with,
   and using its virtualization as a template.

3. **Create a `MuxXXX` struct, which will serve as the lone client of the
   underlying resource.**

   In order to virtualize a hardware resource, we need to create some object
   that has a reference to the underlying hardware resource and that will hold
   the multiple "virtual" devices which clients will interact with. For the SPI
   interface, we call this struct `MuxSpiMaster`:

   ```rust
   /// The Mux struct manages multiple Spi clients. Each client may have
   /// at most one outstanding Spi request.
   pub struct MuxSpiMaster<'a, Spi: hil::spi::SpiMaster> {
       // The underlying resource being virtualized
       spi: &'a Spi,

       // A list of virtual devices which clients will interact with.
       // (See next step for details)
       devices: List<'a, VirtualSpiMasterDevice<'a, Spi>>,

       // Additional data storage needed to implement virtualization logic
       inflight: OptionalCell<&'a VirtualSpiMasterDevice<'a, Spi>>,
   }
   ```

   Here we use Tock's built-in `List` type, which is a LinkedList of statically
   allocated structures that implement a given trait. This type is required
   because Tock does not allow heap allocation in the Kernel.

   Typically, this struct will implement some number of private helper functions
   used as part of virtualization, and provide a public constructor. For now we
   will just implement the constructor:

   ```rust
   impl<'a, Spi: hil::spi::SpiMaster> MuxSpiMaster<'a, Spi> {
       pub const fn new(spi: &'a Spi) -> MuxSpiMaster<'a, Spi> {
           MuxSpiMaster {
               spi: spi,
               devices: List::new(),
               inflight: OptionalCell::empty(),
           }
       }

       // TODO: Implement virtualization logic helper functions
   }
   ```

4. **Create a `VirtualXXXDevice` which will implement the underlying HIL trait**

   In the previous step you probably noticed the list of virtual devices
   referencing a `VirtualSpiMasterDevice`, which we had not created yet. We will
   define and implement that struct here. In practice, both must be defined
   simultaneously because each type references the other. The
   `VirtualSpiMasterDevice` should have a reference to the mux, a `ListLink`
   field (required so that lists of `VirtualSpiMasterDevice`s can be
   constructed), and other fields for data that needs to be stored _for each
   client_ of the virtualizer.

   ```rust
   pub struct VirtualSpiMasterDevice<'a, Spi: hil::spi::SpiMaster> {
       //reference to the mux
       mux: &'a MuxSpiMaster<'a, Spi>,

       // Pointer to next element in the list of devices
       next: ListLink<'a, VirtualSpiMasterDevice<'a, Spi>>,

       // Per client data that must be stored across calls
       chip_select: Cell<Spi::ChipSelect>,
       txbuffer: TakeCell<'static, [u8]>,
       rxbuffer: TakeCell<'static, [u8]>,
       operation: Cell<Op>,
       client: OptionalCell<&'a dyn hil::spi::SpiMasterClient>,
   }

   impl<'a, Spi: hil::spi::SpiMaster> VirtualSpiMasterDevice<'a, Spi> {
       pub const fn new(
           mux: &'a MuxSpiMaster<'a, Spi>,
           chip_select: Spi::ChipSelect,
       ) -> VirtualSpiMasterDevice<'a, Spi> {
           VirtualSpiMasterDevice {
               mux: mux,
               chip_select: Cell::new(chip_select),
               txbuffer: TakeCell::empty(),
               rxbuffer: TakeCell::empty(),
               operation: Cell::new(Op::Idle),
               next: ListLink::empty(),
               client: OptionalCell::empty(),
           }
       }

       // Most virtualizers will use a set_client method that looks exactly like this
       pub fn set_client(&'a self, client: &'a dyn hil::spi::SpiMasterClient) {
           self.mux.devices.push_head(self);
           self.client.set(client);
       }
   }
   ```

   This is the struct that will implement whatever HIL trait we decided on in
   step 1. In our case, this is the `SpiMasterDevice` trait:

   ```rust
   // Given that there are multiple types of operations we might need to queue,
   // create an enum that can represent each operation and the data that operation
   // needs to store.
   #[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq)]
   enum Op {
       Idle,
       Configure(hil::spi::ClockPolarity, hil::spi::ClockPhase, u32),
       ReadWriteBytes(usize),
       SetPolarity(hil::spi::ClockPolarity),
       SetPhase(hil::spi::ClockPhase),
       SetRate(u32),
   }

   impl<Spi: hil::spi::SpiMaster> hil::spi::SpiMasterDevice for VirtualSpiMasterDevice<'_, Spi> {
       fn configure(&self, cpol: hil::spi::ClockPolarity, cpal: hil::spi::ClockPhase, rate: u32) {
           self.operation.set(Op::Configure(cpol, cpal, rate));
           self.mux.do_next_op();
       }

       fn read_write_bytes(
           &self,
           write_buffer: &'static mut [u8],
           read_buffer: Option<&'static mut [u8]>,
           len: usize,
       ) -> ReturnCode {
           self.txbuffer.replace(write_buffer);
           self.rxbuffer.put(read_buffer);
           self.operation.set(Op::ReadWriteBytes(len));
           self.mux.do_next_op();
           ReturnCode::SUCCESS
       }

       fn set_polarity(&self, cpol: hil::spi::ClockPolarity) {
           self.operation.set(Op::SetPolarity(cpol));
           self.mux.do_next_op();
       }

       fn set_phase(&self, cpal: hil::spi::ClockPhase) {
           self.operation.set(Op::SetPhase(cpal));
           self.mux.do_next_op();
       }

       fn set_rate(&self, rate: u32) {
           self.operation.set(Op::SetRate(rate));
           self.mux.do_next_op();
       }

       fn get_polarity(&self) -> hil::spi::ClockPolarity {
           self.mux.spi.get_clock()
       }

       fn get_phase(&self) -> hil::spi::ClockPhase {
           self.mux.spi.get_phase()
       }

       fn get_rate(&self) -> u32 {
           self.mux.spi.get_rate()
       }
   }
   ```

   Now we can begin to see the virtualization logic. Each `get_x()` method just
   forwards calls directly to the underlying hardware driver, as these
   operations are synchronous and non-blocking. But the `set()` calls and the
   read/write calls are queued as operations. Each client can have only a single
   outstanding operation (a common requirement for virtualizers in Tock given
   the lack of dynamic allocation). These operations are "queued" by each client
   simply setting the operation field of its `VirtualSpiMasterDevice` to
   whatever operation it would like to perform next. The Mux can iterate through
   the list of devices to choose a pending operation. Clients learn about the
   completion of operations via callbacks, informing them that they can begin
   new operations.

5. **Implement the logic for queuing requests from capsules.**

   So far, we have sketched out a skelton for how we will queue requests from
   capsules, but not yet implemented the `do_next_op()` function that will
   handle the order in which operations are performed, or how operations are
   translated into calls by the actual hardware driver.

   We know that all operations in Tock are asynchronous, so it is always
   possible that the underlying hardware device is busy when `do_next_op()` is
   called -- accordingly, we need some mechanism for tracking if the underlying
   device is currently busy. We also need to restore the state expected by the
   device performing a given operaion (e.g. the chip select pin in use). Beyond
   that, we just forward calls to the hardware driver:

   ```rust
   fn do_next_op(&self) {
       if self.inflight.is_none() {
           let mnode = self
               .devices
               .iter()
               .find(|node| node.operation.get() != Op::Idle);
           mnode.map(|node| {
               self.spi.specify_chip_select(node.chip_select.get());
               let op = node.operation.get();
               // Need to set idle here in case callback changes state
               node.operation.set(Op::Idle);
               match op {
                   Op::Configure(cpol, cpal, rate) => {
                       // The `chip_select` type will be correct based on
                       // what implemented `SpiMaster`.
                       self.spi.set_clock(cpol);
                       self.spi.set_phase(cpal);
                       self.spi.set_rate(rate);
                   }
                   Op::ReadWriteBytes(len) => {
                       // Only async operations want to block by setting
                       // the devices as inflight.
                       self.inflight.set(node);
                       node.txbuffer.take().map(|txbuffer| {
                           let rxbuffer = node.rxbuffer.take();
                           self.spi.read_write_bytes(txbuffer, rxbuffer, len);
                       });
                   }
                   Op::SetPolarity(pol) => {
                       self.spi.set_clock(pol);
                   }
                   Op::SetPhase(pal) => {
                       self.spi.set_phase(pal);
                   }
                   Op::SetRate(rate) => {
                       self.spi.set_rate(rate);
                   }
                   Op::Idle => {} // Can't get here...
               }
           });
       }
   }
   ```

   Notably, the SPI driver does not implement any fairness schemes, despite the
   requirements of the threat model. As of this writing, the threat model is
   still aspirational, and not followed for all virtualizers. Eventually, this
   driver should be updated to use round robin queueing of clients, rather than
   always giving priority to whichever client was added to the List first.

6. **Implement the logic for dispatching callbacks from the underlying resource
   to the appropriate client.**

   We are getting close! At this point, we have a mechanism for adding clients
   to the virtualizer, and for queueing and making calls. However, we have not
   yet addressed how to handle callbacks from the underlying resource (usually
   used to forward interrupts up to the appropriate client). Additionally, our
   queueing logic is still incomplete, as we have not yet seen when subsequent
   operations are triggered if an operation is requested while the underlying
   device is in use.

   Handling callbacks in virtualizers requires two layers of handling. First,
   the `MuxXXX` device must implement the appropriate `XXXClient` trait such
   that it can subscribe to callbacks from the underlying resource, and dispatch
   them to the appropriate `VirtualXXXDevice`:

   ```rust
   impl<Spi: hil::spi::SpiMaster> hil::spi::SpiMasterClient for MuxSpiMaster<'_, Spi> {
       fn read_write_done(
           &self,
           write_buffer: &'static mut [u8],
           read_buffer: Option<&'static mut [u8]>,
           len: usize,
       ) {
           self.inflight.take().map(move |device| {
               self.do_next_op();
               device.read_write_done(write_buffer, read_buffer, len);
           });
       }
   }
   ```

   This takes advantage of the fact that we stored a reference to device that
   initiated the inflight operation, so we can dispatch the callback directly to
   that device. One thing to note is that the call to `take()` sets `inflight`
   to `None`, and then the callback calls `do_next_op()`, triggering any still
   queued operations. This ensures that all queued operations will take place.
   This all requires that the device also has implemented the callback:

   ```rust
   impl<Spi: hil::spi::SpiMaster> hil::spi::SpiMasterClient for VirtualSpiMasterDevice<'_, Spi> {
   fn read_write_done(
       &self,
       write_buffer: &'static mut [u8],
       read_buffer: Option<&'static mut [u8]>,
       len: usize,
   ) {
       self.client.map(move |client| {
           client.read_write_done(write_buffer, read_buffer, len);
       });
   }
   ```

   Finally, we have dispatched the callback all the way up to the client of the
   virtualizer, completing the round trip process.

7. **Document the interface.**

   Finally, you need to document the interface. Do so by placing a comment at
   the top of the file describing what the file does:

   ```rust
   //! Virtualize a SPI master bus to enable multiple users of the SPI bus.

   ```

   and add doc comments (`/// doc comment example`) to any new traits created in
   `kernel/src/hil`.

8. **(Optional) Write tests for the virtualization logic.**

   Some virtualizers provide additional stress tests of virtualization logic,
   which can be run on hardware to perform correct operation in edge cases. For
   examples of such tests, look at `capsules/src/test/virtual_uart.rs` or
   `capsules/src/test/random_alarm.rs`.

## Wrap-Up

Congratulations! You have virtualized a resource in the Tock kernel! We
encourage you to submit a pull request to upstream this to the Tock repository.
