# Tock Book

Getting started guide for Tock.

[book.tockos.org](https://book.tockos.org/)

This should be generic and expanded as new courses and tutorials are added.

## Building the Book

`make`

This will auto-install some packages at requested versions if needed. If you do
not want tools to auto-install, inspect the Makefile and install the requisite
packages manually.

## Deploying the Book

The book is auto-deployed by Netlify on pushes to the main branch.
