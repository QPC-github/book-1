## Tock's goals, architecture and components

![](imgs/architecture.svg)

A key contribution of Tock is that it uses Rust's borrow checker as a language
sandbox for isolation and a cooperative scheduling model for concurrency in the
kernel. As a result, for the kernel isolation is (more or less) free in terms of
resource consumption at the expense of preemptive scheduling (so a malicious
component could block the system by, e.g., spinning in an infinite loop).

Tock includes three architectural components:

- A small trusted _core kernel_, written in Rust, that implements a hardware
  abstraction layer (HAL), scheduler, and platform-specific configuration.
- _Capsules_, which are compiled with the kernel and use Rust's type and module
  systems for safety.
- _Processes_, which use the memory protection unit (MPU) for protection at
  runtime.

### Check your understanding

1. What kinds of binaries exist on a Tock board? Hint: There are three, and only
   two can be programmed using `tockloader`.

2. What are the differences between capsules and processes? What performance and
   memory overhead does each entail? Why would you choose to write something as
   a process instead of a capsule and vice versa?

3. What happens if the core kernel enters an infinite loop? What about a
   process? What about a capsules?
